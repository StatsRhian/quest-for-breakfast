      <description>Auction Eats
One Saturday morning I decided to go cycling around Catterall for two reasons.
 To get some more cycling tiles around Beacon Fell To try out a new cafe  I was noyt dissapointed! I think this is one of the best breakfasts I&amp;rsquo;ve had so far. The eggs and mushrooms were perfectly cooked, and the hashbrown was crispy. For an extra Â£1 you could have unlimited filter coffee.</description>

      <description>Deli Ecosse
We took the campervan up to Scotland for a couple of days to go walking and running.
We stopped off in Callander to get breakfast before walking up Ben Ledi.
The cafe was quite small and very busy. The most interesting thing about this breakfast was that it came with a vegetable hash, which was good. However, the rest of the breakfsat was quite dissapointing. The mushrooms and tomatos were under cooked.</description>

      <description>Morrisons Cafe, Morecambe
I went swimming with some ladies from MALLOWS (Morecambe and Lancaster Open Water Swimmers) in Morecambe Bay. The sea was calm although a little chilly. You can see the trace on Strava.
Afterwards I popped into Morrisons Morecambe to warm up with a breakfast. I had to wait 30 minutes, as they were super busy, but they did give me an extra coffee whilst I waited.

      <description>Ireby Green Farm
The night before we had been celebrating our friends 10 year engagement party. Yes that&amp;rsquo;s right ten years!
To ride off the hangover we set off early and headed to Ireby in hunt of second breakfast. Our route is on Strava.

One Saturday morning I decided to go [cycling around Catterall](https://www.strava.com/activities/2251590084) for two reasons. 

* To get some more cycling tiles around Beacon Fell
* To try out a new cafe

I was not disappointed! I think this is one of the best breakfasts I've had so far. The eggs and mushrooms were perfectly cooked, and the hashbrown was crispy. For an extra Â£1 you could have unlimited filter coffee. And there was ASPARAGUS! Everything was obivously cooked freshly and tasted fantsatics. I can't wait to go back.

[Deli Ecosse](https://deliecosse.co.uk/)

We took the campervan up to Scotland for a couple of days to go walking and running.

We stopped off in Callander to get breakfast before walking up [Ben Ledi](https://www.strava.com/activities/1849606370).

The cafe was quite small and very busy. The most interesting thing about this breakfast was that it came with a vegetable hash, which was good. However, the rest of the breakfsat was quite dissapointing. The mushrooms and tomatos were under cooked.

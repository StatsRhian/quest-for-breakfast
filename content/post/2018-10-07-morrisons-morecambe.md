[Morrisons Cafe, Morecambe](https://my.morrisons.com/blog/food/new-cafe-menu/)

I went swimming with some ladies from MALLOWS (Morecambe and Lancaster Open Water Swimmers) in Morecambe Bay. The sea was calm although a little chilly. You can see the trace on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/1889378589).

Afterwards I popped into Morrisons Morecambe to warm up with a breakfast. I had to wait 30 minutes, as they were super busy, but they did give me an extra coffee whilst I waited.
